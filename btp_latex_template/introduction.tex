The ever increasing number of wireless users, on one hand, and the realization of insufficient spectral resources, on the other, is a major issue researchers around the world are trying to solve. It has been found that the spectrum shortage crisis is due to inefficient spectrum utilization rather than physical scarcity of the resource. In November 2002, FCC published a report \cite{ref:FCC}  in-order to improve spectrum utilization in the United States. One of the most significant findings of this report is - ``{\em If you look at the entire RF frequency up to $100$GHz, and take a snapshot at any given time, you will see that only 5-10$\%$ of it is being used. So there is $90$ GHz bandwidth available}". Frequency agile radios (cognitive radios) was a revolutionary solution put forth to solve this looming crisis \cite{ref:haykin}.
